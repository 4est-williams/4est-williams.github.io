My Class Project

For my class project, I wanted to make a website that shows off some of my favorite parks in Kentucky.

Every time you see a park, it is put onto the page with a script, so each page is dynamic and will change with each refresh.
In the future, I would like to make each page a little bit more interactive with the addition of lightboxes that tell you more about each individual park without the need to create a whole page for each one.

Thank you for taking the time to view my page!
